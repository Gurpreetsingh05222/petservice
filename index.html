            <p><strong>Consultation (Free)</strong>: This visit should be done a couple days before we are to care for your pet(s) and will take about 30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your pet's routine. We will go over feeding, potty schedule, medications, emergency / vet contacts and other household chores that you would like me to tend to while you are away. This is also a great time for me to get to know your pet and make sure that he / she feels comfortable around me. Once this consultation is done, we will do a key exchange and you can be on your way! Additional consultations will be charged as a 30-minute visit.<br>
                    <strong>visit ($20)</strong>: During each visit, we will spend at least 30-minutes with your pet(s) feeding, scooping litter, walking, running, cleaning up after, brushing and playing.<br>
                    <strong>visit ($35)</strong>: During each visit, we will spend at least one hour with your pet(s) feeding, scooping litter, walking, running, cleaning up after, brushing and playing.<br>
                    <strong>Overnight ($85)</strong>: We will come stay with your pet for the night (8PM-8AM). This is a good option for older pets or pets that need frequent medication or care. This service also includes a morning and evening walk.<br>
